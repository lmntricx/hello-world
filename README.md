I Matt (Nickname), I live in the eastern FreeState
My Real Name however is Mnisi last name Obose, I am an aspiring developer and i would love to learn more on this journey than i can teach myself, I truly hope this will be an insightfull journey that will open my eyes to a lot more things than i initial myself couldn't learn on my own, basically github itself i was even lazy to get into it so it is one of the things i am already learning for the first time.
